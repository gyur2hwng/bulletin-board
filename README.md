# Online Bulletin Board

This project is a jsp-servlet web application that uses MVC2 to create an online bulletin board.

Features: Write Post, Reply to a Post, Edit a Post, Delete a Post, View All Posts, Page Count 

The unique part of this project is the reply feature since it uses three new variables -- ref, re_step, re_level -- to renumber and reorganize the posts based on where the replies were made. Another unique feature is the page count, which displays [prev] [1] [2] [3] [next] on the bottom of the page. 

01_write.jsp is the main file.
